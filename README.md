# Quantum Art Project

## Overview
The Quantum Art Project is an innovative exploration of the intersection between quantum computing and artistic expression. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics, this project aims to generate abstract and visually stunning pieces of art. The project utilizes quantum circuits to encode data and apply probabilistic transformations, resulting in unique artistic outputs.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for quantum art generation.
  - **quantum_art_generator.py**: The main entry point for the quantum art generation process.
  - **quantum_circuits/**: Contains files related to the creation and manipulation of quantum circuits.
    - **art_circuit.py**: Defines the `ArtCircuit` class for generating artistic patterns.
    - **utils.py**: Utility functions for quantum circuit operations.
  - **image_processing/**: Implements image processing techniques to enhance generated art.
    - **filters.py**: Contains various image filtering techniques.
    - **transformations.py**: Functions for applying transformations to images.
    - **utils.py**: Utility functions for image loading and preprocessing.
  - **visualization/**: Handles the visualization of results.
    - **plotter.py**: Functions for plotting quantum circuit outputs and processed images.
    - **renderer.py**: Manages the rendering and saving of final artistic images.

- **data/**: Contains directories for input and output images.
  - **input_images/**: Stores images to be processed.
  - **output_art/**: Saves the generated artistic images.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
  - **quantum_art_experiments.ipynb**: A notebook for testing and visualizing quantum art generation.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- **README.md**: This documentation file.

- **LICENSE**: Outlines the licensing terms for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd quantum-art-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To generate quantum art, run the main script:
```
python src/quantum_art_generator.py
```
This will initiate the process of creating quantum circuits, applying image processing techniques, and rendering the final artistic images.
